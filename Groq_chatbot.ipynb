            "Small language models are typically built using a variant of the transformer architecture, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that has been widely used for natural language processing tasks. They differ from larger language models in the following ways:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Model size**: Small language models are significantly smaller, with fewer parameters and less computational complexity than larger models. This makes them more efficient and easier to deploy on devices with limited resources.\n",

            "3. **Embodied cognition**: Small language models can be used in embodied cognition applications, such as robots or drones that need to understand and respond to spoken language or text-based commands.\n",

It's understandable to feel down when things don't go as planned, especially when you see others celebrating their new beginnings. Just remember that your time will come, and it's only a matter of time before you'll be sharing your own exciting news on LinkedIn. Hang in there, and try to focus on the positive aspects of your situation!\n",

            "Please: The only two types of socks that together form a pair which is not satisfactory is 1 and 3 so the problem is equivalent to finding the probability that each of the two 1-socks is paired with a sock which is not a 3-sock. This can happen in one of two mutually exclusive ways: • The two 1-socks are paired with each other: the sequence of socks drawn without replacement can be viewed as a permutation of the six elements {a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2}, where the two 1-socks correspond to a1 and a2, the two 2-socks correspond to b1 and b2, etc. a1 is just as likely to be paired with any of the other five socks so the probability that it is paired with a2 is 1 5 . • The two 1-socks are each paired with a 2-sock: using the notation of the first case, this is the probability that a1 is paired with one of b1 and b2 and a2 is paired with the other of b1 and b2. P[{a1 is paired with one of b1 and b2} ∩ {a2 is paired with the other of them}] = P[{a1 is paired with one of b1 and b2}] × P[{a2 is paired with the other of them}|{a1 is paired with one of b1 and b2}] = 2 5 × 1 3  where the last equality follows because a1 is just as likely to be paired with any of the other socks, so that there is a 2 5 chance that it is one of b1 or b2. Given that a1 has been paired with one of those socks, among sequences of pairings for which that is true, that leaves 3 equally likely socks for a2 to be paired with, only one of which is a b-sock (2-sock) so that happens with probability 1 3 .  The total probability of having three satisfactory pairs is then 1 5 + 2 5 · 1 3 = 1 3 .  Note that this problem is an easier version of the last problem discussed in the Probability Theory module under Mutually Exclusive Events.  1  Solution 2  Since each arrangement of socks is equally likely, we can count the total number of possible ar- rangements and the number of ones with three satisfactory pairs of socks and then divide those  two numbers. If we consider all socks to be distinguishable (even the two socks of each type compared to each other), there are 6! = 720 ways of drawing the socks without replacement. As mentioned in the first solution, we get three satisfactory pairs exactly when the 1-socks are not paired with 3-socks. We can count the complement: when at least one 1-sock is paired with a 3-sock. There are 2 · 2 · 2 · 4! = 192 arrangements where the first pair is a 1-sock and a 3-sock: 2 choices for the 1-sock in the pair, 2 choices for the 3-sock in the pair, 2 choices to arrange the two in the first pair, and 4! arrangements of the remaining socks in the other 4 positions. This is also true for the number of arrangements where the second pair is a 1-sock with a 3-sock, as well as the third pair, giving 3 · 192 = 576. However, this overcounts cases when there are two pairs of a 1-sock and a 3-sock, for example, when the first pair and the second pair both are the pair, we count those arrangements twice in the last paragraph. To correct for this, we subtract this number of cases. When the two pairs are the first and second ones, the number of such arrangements is 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2! = 32: there are 2 ways to select the 1-sock in the first pair, 2 ways to select the 3-sock in the first pair, 2 ways to arrange the 1-sock and 3-sock in the first pair, 2 ways to arrange the 1-sock and 3-sock in the second pair, and 2! ways of arranging the remaining 2 socks in the third pair. This is true for all 3 2  = 3 possible pairs of pairs of socks with a 1-sock and a 3-sock, giving 3·32 = 96 arrangements. From the principle of inclusion-exclusion, there are 576 − 96 = 480 arrangements with at least one pair of a 1-sock and a 3-sock. This leaves 720 − 480 = 240 arrangements with only satisfactory pairs, so the probability is 240/720 = 1/3 .  Final answer: 1/3 .\n",
